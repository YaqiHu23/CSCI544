## Objects:
Our project mainly focus on the reproducing and extension of the MemSizer model, with  replacing core of a question and answer (Q&A) with Memsizer previously built using transformer. \

Our primary object is to reproduce and validate the results from the MemSizer paper, a cutting-edge memory optimization tool. Moreover, We extended the paper model to a newly published dataset, OpenOrca, which presents challenges and characteristics different from those in the original used datasets.\ 

The integration process involved adapting MemSizer with our existing Q&A system, with aiming of enhancing the system's performance, particularly in term of GPU memory efficiency and training time/model size, also with response accuracy. Moreover, compare both results, to see the performance of the MemSizer.\

## Experiments
Datasets: WMT 16 En-De, XSUM, OpenOrca\
Environment: Google Colab\

## Results
Can be seen in the Report/Group_5_Final_Report\
